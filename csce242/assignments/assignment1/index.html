                    <h2>What Makes That "Krispy Kreme" Style?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Classic Krispy Kreme doughnuts are soft, light, and yeast-raised, with a thin, glossy glaze that shatters softly when you bite.
                         At home, we can’t copy the exact commercial process, but we can get wonderfully close using a rich, well-hydrated dough and a gentle proof.
                        Careful temperature control is the secret: dough that’s too cold won’t rise fully, and oil that’s too hot will brown before the inside cooks.
                         With a simple glaze and a restful rise, your kitchen can turn out doughnuts that taste bakery-fresh and feel feather-light.

                     <p>
                     This guide focuses on technique rather than a proprietary formula, so you learn the “why” behind each step.
                     You’ll mix and proof a yeast dough, shape classic rings, and fry at a steady temperature for even color and lift.
                    After a brief cool, a quick dip in a vanilla glaze adds that signature sheen.
                    Read the tips below, keep your workspace organized, and you’ll be plating warm, melt-in-your-mouth doughnuts in no time.
                    </p>
                    <p class="note"><strong>Safety first:</strong> 
                    Hot oil can cause burns. Use a deep, heavy pot, don’t overfill with oil,
                     and monitor temperature with a thermometer. Keep kids and pets away from the stove while frying.

                <h2>Key Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Mix & Knead:</strong> Combine warm milk, a little sugar, and active dry yeast. Add eggs, melted butter, flour, and salt; knead until smooth and slightly tacky.</li>
                    <li><strong>First Rise:</strong> Cover and proof in a warm spot until doubled (about 1 to 1½ hours depending on room temperature).</li>
                    <li><strong>Shape:</strong> Roll to about ½-inch thick. Cut rings with a doughnut cutter or two round cutters; re-roll scraps once.</li>
                    <li><strong>Second Rise:</strong> Place on parchment, lightly cover, and proof until puffy and delicate (about 30–45 minutes).</li>
                    <li><strong>Fry:</strong> Heat neutral oil to 350–360°F (175–182°C). Fry 45–60 seconds per side until light golden; drain on a rack.</li>
                    <li><strong>Glaze:</strong> Dip warm doughnuts into a thin vanilla glaze (powdered sugar + milk + vanilla) and let set 5–10 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
