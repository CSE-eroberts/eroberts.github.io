                    <h2>What Makes That "Krispy Kreme" Style?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Homemade Krispy Kreme–style doughnuts can be recreated with a rich, well-hydrated dough, gentle proofing, and careful temperature control. The key is proper rising and frying so they stay light and airy, finished with a simple glaze for a bakery-fresh result.
                        </p>
                     <p>
                     This guide teaches doughnut-making technique rather than a secret recipe, explaining the reasons behind each step. You’ll mix and proof yeast dough, shape rings, fry evenly at the right temperature, then glaze for a glossy finish. With the provided tips and good organization, you can enjoy warm, melt-in-your-mouth doughnuts at home.
                     </p>
                    <p class="note"><strong>Safety first:</strong> 
                    Hot oil can cause burns. Use a deep, heavy pot, don’t overfill with oil,
                     and monitor temperature with a thermometer. Keep kids and pets away from the stove while frying.

                  <!-- bulleted list of steps -->
                    <li><strong>Mix & Knead:</strong> Combine warm milk, a little sugar, and active dry yeast. Add eggs, melted butter, flour, and salt; knead until smooth and slightly tacky.</li>
                    <li><strong>First Rise:</strong> Cover and proof in a warm spot until doubled (about 1 to 1½ hours depending on room temperature).</li>
                    <li><strong>Shape:</strong> Roll to about ½-inch thick. Cut rings with a doughnut cutter or two round cutters; re-roll scraps once.</li>
                    <li><strong>Second Rise:</strong> Place on parchment, lightly cover, and proof until puffy and delicate (about 30–45 minutes).</li>
                    <li><strong>Fry:</strong> Heat neutral oil to 350–360°F (175–182°C). Fry 45–60 seconds per side until light golden; drain on a rack.</li>
                    <li><strong>Glaze:</strong> Dip warm doughnuts into a thin vanilla glaze (powdered sugar + milk + vanilla) and let set 5–10 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
